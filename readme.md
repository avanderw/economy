# ecnonomy

This project is a mishmash of concepts currently. They do however fall under the banner of economics.
 
Currently the api consists of threading viewed as a economic supply-consumer relationship. 
Where one thread supplies another thread that can can be a factory which outputs to a consumer or a supplier can just output to one consumer.

There is also an implementation of an asymptotic demand curve which follows the 1/x graph.
